These files make it possible to login to X without a desktop manager.

Usage
=====

To enable automatic login at boot, execute:
# systemctl enable xlogin@<username>

The xlogin service sets up a user session and starts a user instance of
systemd.
Several actions are available to the user.

Logout
------
$ loginctl terminate-session "$XDG_SESSION_ID"
or
$ systemctl --user exit
or
# systemctl stop xlogin@<username>

Shutdown
--------
$ systemctl poweroff
If no other users are logged in, this does not require a password.

Reboot
------
$ systemctl reboot
If no other users are logged in, this does not require a password.


Files
=====

# make install

----------
This service governs an X session on a specified VT. It is of little use on its
own.
