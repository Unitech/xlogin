These files make it possible to login to X without a desktop manager.

Usage
=====

To enable automatic login at boot, execute:
# systemctl enable xlogin\@<username>.service

The xlogin service sets up a user session and runs the users .xinitrc script.
Several actions are available to the user.

Logout
------
$ loginctl terminate-session "$XDG_SESSION_ID"

Shutdown
--------
$ systemctl poweroff
If no other users are logged in, this does not require a password.

Reboot
------
$ systemctl reboot
If no other users are logged in, this does not require a password.


Files
=====

Makefile
--------
This makes installation through
# make install
possible.

x-daemon
--------
This script makes starting X as a daemon possible. It is needed by the systemd
service that manages X.

x@.service
----------
This service governs an X session on a specified VT. It is of little use on its
own.

xlogin@.service
---------------
This service is responsible for setting up the user session and running the
user's .xinitrc script. The script should not return.


Known Bugs
==========

Stopping a user session through
# systemctl stop xlogin\@<username>
does not take down programs forked from the .xinitrc script.
